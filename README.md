This assembly code shows how to use the stack in Y86. The code reads "input" from an array and stores "output" in a second array. When the input is even, rf is called torecursively multiply 1 or 2 to result until all values used, notibely there are two recursive calls. If the input is odd, mult is called to multiply the inserted value by itself (square). Before it checks for odd or even it goes to a function to find the absolute value of num and uses that value for the functions. Ultimately the code terminates when num is zero.
